\subsection{Justification of the Toxicity-Aware Distance}
To evaluate whether our 
newly proposed toxicity-aware distance 
between two sentences aligns more closely with human-annotated distance scores compared to the cosine similarity-based distance, we utilized responses generated by vicuna-13b. 
Specifically, following the methodology presented in \cite{qi2024visual}, we performed visual jailbreak attacks on the clean samples in the figure below. For each given harmful textual prompt, we conducted 5 inferences using clean visual prompts and 15 inferences using jailbreak visual prompts.
